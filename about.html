        <h2>Homesteading</h2>
        <p>I am currently maintaining a 30 acre homestead in Tennessee. With so far 6 raised bed gardens, 10 chickens, and 3 dogs.
            Current projects are adding a greenhouse, a herd of goats, a barn for tractor storage, and more garden beds.

        <h2>Hiking</h2>
        <p>When ever I get time I enjoy hiking in the Great Smoky Mountains, in Tennessee State Parks, or on some of the trails I maintain on my homestead.</p>

    <section class="about-section">        <h2>Fishing</h2>
        I enjoy kayak fishing alot. It's very relaxing just floating down the rivers in the area while waiting for the fish to bite. When they do you will be going for a ride if the fish is big enough.
